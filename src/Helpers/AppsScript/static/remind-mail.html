      Hi Hack4Impact <?= chapterName ?>,
    </p>

    <p>
      We noticed <?= nonprofitName ?> hasn't responded to the
      <?= readableTimePeriod ?> project success survey that was scheduled to be
      sent out 2 weeks ago. This is a friendly reminder to send the survey to
      <?= nonprofitName ?> within the next week if you haven't done so already,
      or follow up with them if you already have. We have included information
      about the project and an email template below.
    </p>

    <p>Project Information:</p>
    <blockquote>
      <p>Project Name: <?= projectName ?></p>
      <p>Nonprofit Name: <?= nonprofitName ?></p>
      <p>Creation Semester: <?= creationSemester ?></p>
      <p>Nonprofit POC: <?= nonprofitContactName ?></p>
      <p>Nonprofit POC Email: <?= nonprofitContactEmail ?></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Email Template:</p>
